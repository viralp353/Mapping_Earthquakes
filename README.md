# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Object:


In this module,use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

## Challenge:



### Challenge_Background:




In this challenge,add a third map style as an additional tile layer. also add tectonic plate GeoJSON data to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.





### Challenge_Object:



#### The goals for this challenge:

*  Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.


*  Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.


*  Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.


*  Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
